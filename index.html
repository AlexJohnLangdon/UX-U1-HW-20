            <h3>The Project</h3>
            <p>With bushfire’s ravaging through rural  Australian communities on an annual basis, it is important that those affected have access to trade persons who can assist in helping them rebuild bushfire affected properties.</p>
            <p>We have completed a redesign the website layout, create a menu section and consolidate forms to enhance the user experience</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>We have observed the manual multistep process to create an account and register to request a services results in long wait times for fire affected communities, unable to access the help they need.</p>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>By providing a streamlined platform allowing users in need and volunteers to communicate with one another, help is getting to those who need it, faster and more efficiently. By also allowing non-skilled individuals to volunteer their time or donate towards helping those in need, we have added an entire demographic previously not accounted for.

          <h2 class="display-4">User Research</h2>
        </div>
        <h3>What We Did</h3>
        <p>Research began by designating our main target audience of tradesmen & women and/or people affected by the devastating bushfires.</p>
        <p>This initial step led to the creation of a simple survey sent out to the public and a questionnaire, from which we conducted 5 one on one interviews to gauge potential users thoughts and feelings on donating/volunteering online, how users register to volunteer their services to charitable organisations and if users understand how the volunteer process works through browsing the website. </p>

        <p>From this data we concluded that while most individuals are happy to donate online, they can be turned off my long drawn out application processes and by being asked to many private details. The users who did donate regularly used recognised sites and would do so regularly.

        <h3>What We Did</h3>
        <p>Reflecting on the information we gathered, we began developing solutions to the specific issues raised by our participants. </p>
        <p>We concluded that it was most important for this site to;</p>
        <p>Connect skilled tradespeople and volunteers with the people whose properties were destroyed in the bushfire</p>
        <p>Grant the users access to a database that allows volunteers to find upcoming working bees and volunteer opportunities</p>
        <p>Give users the ability to donate money as well as materials to help cover the cost of the rebuilding</p>
        <p>Streamline the registration process to have tradies signed up in a matter of minutes, ready to assist.</p>
        <p>From here it was a matter of defining our user and how they might interact with the site.</p>

       <p class="marginTop">Meet James, he’s your classic Aussie tradie with a keen interest in doing his part to help out those who need it. Like many others, James has the skills to help, but he doesn’t know where to begin.</p>
       <p>James’s story will hopefully be a lot like many others, turning his passion to lend a hand to those affected by the bushfires into action. Using the new and improved ‘Tradies for the Bushfire Rebuild’ site, James can register his services in minutes and be connected directly to the people that need his help the most.</p>

              <p class="card-text">These became the primary actions on our website and informed our initial wireframe design.

    </div>
    <p>As you can see with our final design and prototype, our focus was to streamline the application process and create an efficient volunteering system that can be accessed by many. We also implemented a donation feature for users who want to assist but can’t offer their time.</p>
    <p>A few things we learnt during this process were:</p>
    <p>Designing forms is challenging and forces you to be creative when trying to get users to provide all information you require but also finding a way to keep the form engaging, so that users continue through to completion.</p>
    <p>Also Testing is one of the most important stages, you really don’t know how well your design works until people not attached to it try it out. it also makes you humble to know your initial idea may not always be the best method for the desired outcome.</p>
    <p>In conclusion we feel as though we have achieved our goal and that will hopefully be represented by the increase in volunteer registrations and also donations made to the organisation. Our next steps would be to design the next process and focus on connecting volunteers to upcoming opportunities once registered.</p>
